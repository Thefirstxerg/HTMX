# django-htmx-todo-list

Quick example of a todo list application using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)

## Background

Modified & expanded from https://github.com/jaredlockhart/django-htmx-todo/

This project lets you build todo lists. It demonstrates functionality with django and HTMX, including use of modal forms, adding multiple forms to a list (an alternative to traditional django formsets), and deleting items from a list (or an entire list).

The original project used class-based Django views. That has been improved to use function-based views (see [Django Views â€” The Right Way](https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/) to read why FBV is often the better approach!)

There are actually two example projects here which are the same in all respects except that `tasker` uses hard-coded html forms, and `tasker2` uses django forms with [django-crispy-forms](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/django-crispy-forms) for formatting.

This project is very basic. It does not make use of authorization or other common important concerns. The focus is 100% on demonstrating some Django & HTMX concepts.
